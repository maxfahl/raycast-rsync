# Rsync Commands

Save your commonly used rsync commands in one place and run them with ease. Supports SSH endpoint configuration together
with all the options supported by rsync.

#### Features:

1. Create, update, delete and duplicate pre-configured rsync commands.
2. Pin your most used commands.
3. Run one of your save commands directly from Raycase, or copy the rsync command to run yourself in the terminal.

#### Requirements:

- rsync version 3+ (tested only on 3.2.3 so far).
- rsync has to be in your PATH.

#### Known Issues:

- After first selecting `Source` or `Destination` for `SSH` in your commands, you can't simply swap to the other option without first selecting `None`. I can't figure out why this doesn't work since the state for where the fields should render is updating correctly. The view doesn't seem to agree with this somehow and refuses to change position of the fields.
